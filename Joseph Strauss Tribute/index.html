         <h3>His Beginning</h3>
         <p class="col-xs-8" style="font-size: 18px">
The chief engineer of one of the world's most famous bridges was born in Cincinnati, Ohio on January 9, 1870. He came from an artistic family as his mother was a pianist and his father was a writer as well as a painter. The interest in bridges sparked during his college years while he was hospitalized and his room overlooked the John A. Roebling Suspension Bridge. Despite his short hospitalization, Strauss was a dedicated college student serving as class president and class poet as well as a bother in the Sigma Alph Epsilon fraternity. Upon graduating the University of Cincinnati in 1892, he worked for at the Office of Ralph Modjeski, a firm which specialized in building bridges. He proposed ideas for improving bridge's build quality but these ideas were rejected. He later quit the firm and started his own firm, the Strauss Bascule Bridge Company of Chicago, where he revolutionized the design of bascule bridges. Strauss and his firm helped build numerous bridges such as: the Burnside Bridge (1926), the Lewis and Clark Bridge (1930), and the Cherry Street Strauss Trunnion Bascule Bridge (1930).</p>
         <h3>His Masterpiece</h3>
         <p style="font-size: 18px">Strauss had to overcome many problems when facing the daunting task of engineering the Golden Gate Bridge. Some of the problems he faced included finding funding for the bridge, figuring how to construct a bridge over one of the greatest distances ever spanned, how the bridge would reach heights never seen before, and how the bridge would hold up against the mighty forces of the ocean. While in construction, Strauss was concerned with the safety of his workers. He required that a net be installed beneath the Golden Gate Bridge. This net saved a total of 19 lives. Throughout all the hard work and dedication, the bridge opened on May 27, 1937, marking a tremendous day in human history.</p>
